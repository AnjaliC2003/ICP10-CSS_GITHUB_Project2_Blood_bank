            After donating blood, the body works to replenish the blood loss. This stimulates the production of new blood cells and in turn, helps in maintaining good health.

            TYPES OF DONATION
        </h2>
        <p>
            The average human body contains about five liters of blood, which is made of several cellular and non-cellular components such as <u>Red blood cell</u>, <u>Platelet</u>, and <u>Plasma</u>. Each type of component has its unique properties and can be used for different indications. The donated blood is separated into these components by the blood centre and one donated unit can save upto four lives depending on the number of components separated from your blood

                Blood Collected straight from the dom into a blood bag and mixed with an anticoagulant is called as whole blood.

                This collected whole blood is then centrifuged and red cell, platelets and plasma are separated. The separated Red cells are mixed with a preservative to be called as packed red blood cells.
            </p>

                The straw-coloured liquid in which red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets float in is called plasma. Contains special nutrients which can be used to create 18 different type of medical products to treat many different medical conditions. Plasma can be obtained from the collected whole blood after red blood cells and platelets have been separated. Additionally, it can also be collected using an apheresis equipment where other components are returned to the donor. The former is a common method of plasma preparation in our country.

                One can donate whole blood from which the blood centre will separate platelets from other components. Criteria similar to whole blood donation apply. Alternatively, one can donate using apheresis equipment where only platelets are collected and rest components are returned back to donate. One need to satisfy whole blood criteria and pre- donation screening which include negative infectious markers and platelet count >1,50,000 per microlitre of blood. Weight should be >50kgs.
