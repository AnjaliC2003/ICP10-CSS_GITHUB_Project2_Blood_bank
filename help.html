                    ABOUT BLOOD DONATION <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                A voluntary medical procedure through which blood, or one of its components,
                 is transfused from a healthy person to an ill person who needs blood.
                 This is needed for millions of people every year,
                  and the process is used in surgeries or accidents or for some diseases that required blood transfusion.

   <li> What is blood ?</li> 
   </ul>
   <br>
    <p>
    One can almost say that blood is that magic potion which gives life to another person. 
    Though we have made tremendous discoveries and inventions in Science we are not yet able to make the magic potion called Blood.
     Human blood has no substitute.
      Requirement of safe blood is increasing and regular voluntary blood donations are vital for blood transfusion services.

<li> eligibility criteria of blood donation </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Donor should be between 18-55 years of age with a weight of 50 kg or above with pulse rate, body temperature and blood pressure should be normal.
      Both men and women can donate. 
     There are only few conditions in which donors are permanently excluded. 
     The donor with history of epilepsy, psychotic disorders, abnormal bleeding tendencies, severe asthma, 
     cardiovascular disorders, malignancy are permanently unfit for blood donation.
      Donors suffering from disease like hepatitis, malaria, measles, mumps, and syphilis may donate blood after full recovery with 3-6 months gap. 
      blood transfusion may safely donate blood after 6-12 mths for woman donors who are pregnant or
       lactating blood is not taken as their iron reserves are already on the lower side.

    <br>

    <ul type = "disc">
       <li>How much blood can be taken ?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Our body has 5.5 ltr of blood of which only 350 ml - 450 ml of blood is taken depending upon weight of donor.
     Majority of healthy adults can tolerate withdrawal of one unit of blood. 
     The withdrawn blood volume is restored within 24 hours and the hemoglobin and cell components are restored in 2 months. 
     Therefore it is safe to donate blood every three months.
